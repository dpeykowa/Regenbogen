                        Our dream was to create a one-of-a-kind open-top car. We made it come true with the RS Spyder V12, an unrivaled gem of a supercar. Equipped with an exclusive technology package, the jewel in this car's crown is its carbon fiber monocoque. The elegance
                        and vanity of a Spyder meet the power of a naturally aspirated 6.5 liter V-12 engine putting out 515 kW (700 CV), with incredible torque available at all engine speeds. The RS Spyder is an open-top supercar that combines sportiness
                        and style.

                        Electric Cars use the energy stored in a battery (or series of batteries) for vehicle propulsion. Electric motors provide a clean and safe alternative to the internal combustion engine. There are many pros and cons about electric cars. The electric vehicle
                        is known to have faster acceleration but shorter distance range than conventional engines.
